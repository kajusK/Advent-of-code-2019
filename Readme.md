Advent of code 2019
===================

What's the best way to learn a programming language? Get a challenge and start
programming, therefore as a C developer, I tried to finish Advent of Code 2019
in python. Don't take the code very serious, it's python code written in C code style,
I would say.
Also it's not optimized at all, once I got the result, I moved to other day without
looking back.

Due to a lack of time, the last finished item is day 17.
